In this project, I explore data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Data Repository and create a forecast for COVID-19 activity. 

Are our efforts to flatten the curve working? Will there be another peak of virus in the Winter season? 

Using predictive modeling, let's answer this question!
